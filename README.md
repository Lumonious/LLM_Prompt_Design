# LLM Prompt Design with Guidance: A Practical Exploration

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository showcases a completed assignment focused on exploring and demonstrating various **Large Language Model (LLM) prompt design techniques**. The project specifically leverages the **Guidance framework** to achieve more controlled and structured outputs from LLMs, providing a practical understanding of advanced prompt engineering.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary goal of this assignment was to:

* **Experiment with diverse prompt design strategies** to influence LLM behavior.
* **Utilize the Guidance framework** to define and enforce specific output structures and conditional logic within prompts.
* **Integrate with the OpenAI API** to generate real-world LLM responses based on the designed prompts.
* **Analyze and compare the effectiveness** of different prompt techniques in achieving desired outcomes for a chosen topic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
* **Guidance Framework**: Used for defining structured and dynamic prompts.
* **OpenAI API**: For interacting with LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to generate responses.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (or similar)**: For interactive development, execution, and documentation of the prompts and analysis.

## üìÇ Project Structure & Key Steps

The project involved the following key phases:

1.  **Topic Selection**: A specific topic was chosen to serve as the subject matter for all LLM interactions.
2.  **Prompt Design**: Multiple prompts were meticulously crafted for the chosen topic, each embodying a distinct prompt design technique and utilizing Guidance's syntax (`{{gen}}`, `{{#if}}`, etc.) to control the LLM's output.
3.  **LLM Interaction**: The designed prompts were executed via the OpenAI API, capturing the generated responses.
4.  **Response Analysis**: A thorough analysis was conducted on the LLM outputs. This involved comparing the clarity, relevance, structure, and overall quality of responses generated by different prompt techniques.
5.  **Discussion & Conclusion**: The findings were documented, discussing which prompt design technique proved most effective for the chosen topic and why, highlighting the benefits of using a framework like Guidance for controlled LLM generation.
